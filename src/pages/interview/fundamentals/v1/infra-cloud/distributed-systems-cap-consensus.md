## Distributed Systems: CAP & Consensus

Distributed systems power modern scalable, resilient applications. But they introduce fundamental challenges: **how to remain consistent, available, and fault-tolerant despite failures and network partitions**. Two cornerstone ideas help us reason about these systems: the **CAP theorem** and **consensus algorithms** like **Paxos** and **Raft**.


## 1. The CAP Theorem

![CAP Theorem](/images/officialcto/cg_cap.png)

**Definition**: In any distributed system, you can only guarantee two of the following three properties at the same time:  

- **Consistency (C)** – All nodes see the same data at the same time.  
- **Availability (A)** – Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail.  
- **Partition Tolerance (P)** – The system continues to operate despite network failures.  

### Trade-offs
- **CP (Consistency + Partition tolerance)**: Prioritize correctness, may sacrifice availability. Example: ZooKeeper.  
- **AP (Availability + Partition tolerance)**: Prioritize serving requests, may allow stale reads. Example: DynamoDB, Cassandra.  
- **CA**: Rarely practical because network partitions always exist.

👉 **Interview Tip**: Be ready to reason about trade-offs: *“For a payment system I’d choose CP, for a social feed AP is acceptable.”*



## 2. Consensus in Distributed Systems

Distributed systems often need nodes to agree on a single value: *who is the leader? what’s the next transaction?*. This agreement process is called **consensus**.

Two famous protocols are **Paxos** (theoretically foundational but complex) and **Raft** (practically adopted for being easier to understand).

---

### Paxos (Leslie Lamport, 1990)

**Goal**: Ensure a cluster of nodes agree on one value, even if some nodes or messages fail.

**Roles**:  
- **Proposers** → suggest values.  
- **Acceptors** → vote and decide.  
- **Learners** → learn the chosen value.

#### Phases (simplified)
1. **Prepare Phase**: Proposer sends a numbered proposal. Acceptors promise to ignore lower numbers.  
2. **Accept Phase**: If majority promised, proposer asks acceptors to accept its value.  
3. **Learning Phase**: Once majority accepts, the value is chosen and shared.

#### Why it matters
- Tolerates node crashes and message loss.  
- Guarantees **safety** (no conflicting decisions).  
- But is difficult to implement correctly.

👉 **Interview Tip**: Mention *majority quorum* and *two-phase agreement*.

### Raft (2014, Ongaro & Ousterhout)

Raft was designed to be easier to understand while solving the same consensus problem.

**Roles**:  
- **Leader** – central authority for client requests.  
- **Followers** – passive, replicate leader’s log.  
- **Candidates** – temporary role during leader elections.

#### Phases
1. **Leader Election**: Followers become candidates if they don’t hear from a leader. Majority votes elects a leader.  
2. **Log Replication**: Leader appends commands and replicates to followers. Once a majority acknowledge, the entry is committed.  
3. **Safety via Terms**: Each election has a term number; outdated leaders cannot override newer ones.

#### Why it matters
- Simpler mental model than Paxos.  
- Widely used in systems like **etcd (Kubernetes)**, **Consul**, **Nomad**.  
- Provides both consensus and log replication.

👉 **Interview Tip**: Highlight *leader-driven replication* and *simplicity over Paxos*.

### Paxos vs Raft (Comparison)

![Paxos vs Raft](/images/officialcto/cg_paxos_raft.png)

| Feature            | Paxos                           | Raft                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Understandability  | Harder, academic                | Easier, designed for teaching          |
| Roles              | Proposer, Acceptor, Learner     | Leader, Follower, Candidate            |
| Decision making    | Multiple proposers may race     | Single leader coordinates              |
| Log Replication    | Not explicit in basic Paxos     | Built-in, core to protocol             |
| Usage in practice  | ZooKeeper, Chubby, Spanner      | etcd, Consul, Kubernetes control plane |



## 3. Key Takeaways

- **CAP Theorem** → you can’t have it all, must reason about trade-offs.  
- **Consensus** → majority agreement ensures safety, but limits availability during partitions.  
- **Paxos** → correct but complex, foundational in theory.  
- **Raft** → leader-based, simpler, widely used in practice.  



## 4. Practice Question

> *“Design a leader election mechanism for a distributed system that tolerates partitions. Which consensus protocol would you choose and why?”*

- For **theory-heavy discussion**: Paxos (quorum, two-phase).  
- For **practical engineering**: Raft (leader election, log replication, used in Kubernetes).  



## 5. Interview Answer Example

> “In a distributed key-value store, I’d use Raft. A leader handles client writes, replicates logs to followers, and commits entries once a majority acknowledge. This ensures consistency and fault tolerance, at the cost of temporary unavailability during partitions.”
